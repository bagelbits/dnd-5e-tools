# Encounter

Just some silly tools built in Elixir for D&D 5e. This project is just an excuse to learn Elixir and may morph into something else. Or it might fizzle out into nothing. Who can say?

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `dnd_5e_tools` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:dnd_5e_tools, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/dnd_5e_tools](https://hexdocs.pm/dnd_5e_tools).
